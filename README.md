# Inferno Labs

Inferno Labs is a singleplayer Quake Map that I worked on as a project for my Game Design II class at Columbia Colleg Chicago. 

The map takes place in a underground military base that is only accessible through an underwater passageway that is traveled through a submarine. When the player starts the map they wake up inside a submarine after losing consciousness. The player has to try to make their way through the base to discover why it had been abandoned and what the source of the attack was.
